# UI Automation

This is the sample test automation task in which below test scenario is included:
    
    
Scenario: Validate user registration on Miro
Go to sign up page of Miro <br />
Fill all the details <br />
Click start now button <br />
Verify that user is redirected to check your email page <br />
        
In ideal case. We should add unique data-testIDs in dev project so that it is easy to handle all locators. Current project has less unique IDs to handle.

We can add negative and edge cases also in this project but the focus is on framework and design.
